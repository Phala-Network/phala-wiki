Khala Network is Phala's canary network on Kusama Parachain featuring decentralized TEE mining. We provide an overview to setup the mining environment, followed by a detailed explanation of each step.

We highly recommend miners to first read about Phala's [tokenomic]({{< relref "docs/tokenomic" >}}) and [staking mechanism]({{< relref "docs/tokenomic/1-mining-staking" >}}) to understand the calculation of incomings and how the mining proceeds.
