title: "1.4 Benchmarking"
---

The local benchmark feature is not supported any more. Please run the full mining client, and follow the regular deployment guide. After the worker is registered on the blockchain, you can read the performance score from the blockchain (at [Phala App](https://app.phala.network)).

Note that benchmarking on the mainnet (Khala) requires to set up real accounts to pay the transaction fee. To test without real coins, you can refer to our [Testnet Mining Guide]({{< relref "docs/para-mining" >}}).
