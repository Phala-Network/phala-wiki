title: "2 Solo Mining in Para-1 Testnet"
---

{{< tip "warning" >}}
Para-1 is the Parachain testnet of Phala Network (and Khala Network). The purpose of running a testnet is to capture the chaos and collect feedback before the launch of the functionalites on Khala Network. So the system is subject to change. In this tutorial, we always refer to the testnet unless explicitly mentioned.

The following tutorials apply to Para-1 Testnet, which shares the same tokenomics parameters as the future Khala.
<!-- The difference between Para-1 Testnet and Khala is the underlying relaychain, which should be opaque to the miners. -->

Before you start mining in Para-1 Testnet, you need to first [get a Khala account]({{< relref "docs/khala-user" >}}) and acquire test token from faucet (real PHA is needed in future Khala mining).

## Claim Test Token from Telegram Bot

1. Get to Phala Faucet https://t.me/phalafaucet. You may need to download and install Telegram as prompted. Click "VIEW IN TELEGRAM" to join the group.
