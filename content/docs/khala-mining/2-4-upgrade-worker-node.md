title: "2.4 Upgrade Worker Node"

{{< tip "warning" >}}
Para-1 is the Parachain testnet of Phala Network (and Khala Network). The purpose of running a testnet is to capture the chaos and collect feedback before the launch of the functionalites on Khala Network. So the system is subject to change. In this tutorial, we always refer to the testnet unless explicitly mentioned.

To upgrade your worker requires it to stop first.

```bash
sudo phala stop
```

The worker node can be updated in a clean way which removes all the saved data

```bash
sudo phala update clean
```

or with the data preserved

```bash
sudo phala update
```

Finally, restart your worker with:

```bash
sudo phala start
```
